title: "Design Goal of this project"
---

This Project aims to reinterpret / remake mongoose in modern version of EcmaScript (ES) & in TypeScript

## Main Differences

- This Project aims to not cache anything, to be a class per class basis (to prevent decorator execution order problems that we encounterd in the first typegoose)
- It aims to be future proof & maintainable

## What this project does not aim todo

- to be compatible with mongoose / the first typegoos
- to support mongoose plugins
